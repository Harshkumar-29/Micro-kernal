MiniWare OS is a mini command-line operating system simulation written in C for a B.Tech Operating Systems project. It demonstrates core OS concepts such as process management, file system simulation, boot sequence, and custom shell interface. The system starts with a boot animation, initializes memory and services, and provides an interactive shell (root@MiniWare) where users can run commands like ps, date, createfile, listfiles, and cat. It also supports reboot and shutdown functionality with colored terminal output for a realistic OS feel. This project is designed for educational purposes to understand system programming and operating system fundamentals.# Micro-kernal
